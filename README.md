 ### Project idea:
The topic of the project is computer systems intended for the performance of various jobs in the hotel.
The idea is to present the principle of operation of the system, which is intended for the performance of the staff's work in the hotel, on a smaller set of basic functionalities.
The name of the project is HOME, which is an acronym for Hotel Organizations and Management Exercises that further describes this topic.

### Description
HOME is a console application intended for performing various administrative tasks that occur in hotels.
This application allows users to easily perform various tasks such as organizing rooms and scheduling reservations as well as managing the user accounts of its employees.
Given that the hotel system is complex in terms of all the roles that exist in it, from receptionists, accountants, hall managers to administrators, two roles with which the basic interaction that typically appears in hotel systems is established are singled out here. Using these roles and functionalities in the system, this application becomes an example of a basic application that enables hotel employees to achieve better and higher quality tasks during the reception and response of guests.
